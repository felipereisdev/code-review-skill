Every API handler parses its request body with the zod schema of the route
before it reads any field of `req.body`.

## Bad

```ts
export async function createUser(req: Request) {
  const email = req.body.email;
}
```

## Good

```ts
export async function createUser(req: Request) {
  const { email } = CreateUserBody.parse(req.body);
}
```
